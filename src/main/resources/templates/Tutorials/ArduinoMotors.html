		Arduino 3-player reflex game

		I've been looking forward to making an Arduino post for a while, but I couldn't settle
		on an idea that would be simple to reproduce with common parts. But a few days ago I was
		playing keep-away with my roommates dog and I realized... everybody loves a reflex game- even dogs.
		<br/><span class="tab"></span>
		The Arduino would be the perfect hardware platform for a reflex game. Its clock speed is
		fast enough to handle split-second logic decisions, and the software / hardware 
		would it extremely simple to make. ([Input] is handled by buttons and a vibration sensor,
		[output] is handled with LEDs).

		Here is a video of it in action. When the blue LED is on, the Arduino listens for a vibration,
		which is triggered by dropping an object on the table. When the vibration sensor is tripped, the yellow
		light activates, and the first person to press their
		button wins- but if a button is pressed before the sensor is triggered, that player is disqualified
		for the round. Press the Reset button (sticking straight up, out of view) and everybody is ready to play again.

		I was really dreading having to draw-out the circuit diagrams for this post, but I found a 
		(really cool) website that not only lets you drag-and-drop all the physical components,
		but you can run code on a virtualized arduino too! 
		<a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9fSLeXs1oCg-reflexgamearduino/editel"> 
		    You can view / modify the entire virtualized end result here.

		For all the Arduino posts I make, I will assume you have wires, a breadboard
		to make the connections, and the device itself. I am using the Uno R3, which is about $15 new.
		The rest of the hardware needed for this comes with almost every Arduino starter kit, which you can get 
		fairly cheaply. 
		<br/><span class="tab"></span>
		I will also assume you have the Arduino's [IDE], 
		<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software"> 
		    which you can download for free from the Arduino website.

		Vibration is detected with a [piezoelectric] sensor. When the sensor is disturbed, it generates
		a small voltage difference between it's two terminals. The Arduino can sense this voltage if the
		circuit is wired correctly.

		If you are following along, wire up the Arduino and breadboard like this. Note that all
		[Black] wires are those connected to ground.

		The Piezo has 2 terminals. One is connected to ground, the other is connected
		to port A0. The A0-A6 ports are [Analog ports], so they
		can detect any voltage between 0 and 5 volts, while the [Digital] ports can only
		detect voltage-high or voltage-low.
		<br/><span class="tab"></span>
		A 1 million Ohm resistor allows the Piezo's value to be read clearly. (To be honest,
		I had to look up someone else's guide to wire the Piezo correctly)
	    </p>

	    <p class="singleElement para">
		<span class="tab"></span>
		To get a good understanding how it will read the Piezo, run this mini
		program on your Arduino.

		If you tap the Piezo with your finger, the Arduino should read a voltage of around 0.2 V or so.
		Hitting it harder will momentarily read a higher voltage, up to 5V
		Since this exceeds the [voltageThreshold] value, the IDE's console should display a message.

		The Piezo is an example of [physical logic].
		But almost all of the
		work is done by this device is through [virtual logic]- 
		the code running inside the Arduino. 
		The Arduino's usefulness comes from it's ability to seamlessly mix physical and virtual logic, to allow real-world
		interaction to control software and vice versa.
		<br/><span class="tab"></span>
		The rest of the interaction comes only from the few buttons used by this program
		and the colored LEDs that show the Game State. Everything else about the [Game State] will be held
		in software.

		[Make sure the Arduino is powered off], then
		add the following components to the circuit. Step 1's Piezo and wires are not shown,
		but don't remove them.

		The recommended max current through an Arduino port is around 20 milliamps. When a digital port is set
		to output a current with the [digitalWrite] command, it does so at [5 Volts].
		<a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/electric/ohms-law.html"> 
		    5 Volts = 0.02 Amps * 250 Ohms, 
		</a> so a resistor of around 250 Ohms is between the digital port and ground. A more-common 220 Ohm
		resistor (Stripe pattern: Red Red Brown) will do the trick just fine though.
