		I can’t post my art on StackExchange and I can’t put programming tutorials on DeviantArt, so I made this site. Welcome.
		<br/><br/><span class="tab"/>
		Since I was young I’ve held a deep passion for both art and technology. Learning art allowed me to practice creative
		expression, a zone where there is no such thing as a wrong answer to a problem. Learning computers taught me 
		the opposite- the gears won’t turn until every part is in the proper place.
		I knew I’d one day want a job that combined these two ways of thinking- and what better than computer programming?
		<br/><br/><span class="tab"/>
		I started learning in high school, making little simple games in Java. I joined the Marines in 2011 as a Data 
		Network Specialist, where I learned the ins and outs of the technologies that allow the web to function, 
		and continued practicing programming in my off-hours. This thing called ‘iPhone’ was pretty popular, so I made 
		
		<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/davis-burnside/id920372367"> The Logic Gates </a>
		for it in 2014.
		<br/><br/><span class="tab"/>
		After leaving the Marines in 2015, I attended college in California and started work on my next app, 
		<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/davis-burnside/id920372367"> Choss </a>.
		 My latest work involves working with the Spring framework in Java, which is what runs this server and the others I work on.
